# Credit Risk Classification

## Problem Statement

This project aims to predict the credit risk of loan applicants. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify applicants as either high-risk or low-risk, based on a set of features provided in the dataset.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project is the `application_train.csv` file from the Home Credit Default Risk competition on Kaggle. It contains a variety of financial and personal information about loan applicants. The target variable is `TARGET`, where 1 indicates a high-risk applicant and 0 indicates a low-risk applicant.
